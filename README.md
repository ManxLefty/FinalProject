# Escape from Alabastor Manor

Create a one player adventure game through a haunted house. The player can walk through rooms and fight monsters that spawn in the rooms. Some rooms have riddles that must be solved for you to be able to enter the room and move through it. The goal is to move your way through the house until you encounter the final boss. Once you defeat the final boss, you can escape the house.

The rooms are based off the code created by John Foley.
